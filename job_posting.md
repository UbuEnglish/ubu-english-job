# Senior Python Developer - Document Processing Pipeline

## Strategic Context

We're developing an innovative ESL learning platform powered by AI, starting with a crucial foundation: a sophisticated markdown processing system for LLM training data preparation. This technical assessment project represents more than just a coding task‚Äîit's an opportunity to demonstrate strategic thinking and potentially establish a long-term partnership in educational technology.

*Note: While this is a focused 4-6 week project, we're particularly interested in agencies and developers who can contribute to our broader vision of AI-enhanced language learning.*

**Key Aspects**:
- Demonstrate innovative approaches to AI/ML integration
- Showcase architectural decision-making
- Balance technical excellence with strategic thinking

**Quick Facts**:
- üïí Duration: 4-6 week assessment
- üìç Remote: Yes
- üîß Type: Contract with potential for long-term collaboration
- ü§ñ Development: AI-assisted workflow
- üéØ Goal: Technical excellence and strategic partnership
